**Backstory:**  
Sherieff R., fellow UX writer, shares this thought experiment within the UX Writing Community.

**The victims:**  
A charity aimed at helping domestically-abused women, The River Manchester's website's lower banner CTA and headers have some major UX issues. The flaw comes when a user clicks the "Get me out of here" button.

When users want to know what the button does, they'll read this in the modal:

> > What's this? Clicking the "Get me out of here" button (or pressing the Esc key on your keyboard) will direct you away from this site to a google search for "headache". It will NOT clear your browser history however and so we strongly recommend that you view this site in a Private Browsing window if you are concerned about your safety. **\[Ok, got it.\]**

The warning message tells three things:

1\. You're on the wrong website, so get out of here;  
2\. What you're going through isn't a big deal;  
3\. Use a private browsing window if you're concerned about companies tracking your online activities.

Now, if I'm (or someone) a domestic abuse survivor, the message would come off as tone-deaf and condescending.

Not that I'd want to wish ill to their cause, but writing something like a message like the one above would tarnish the charity's efforts and perhaps lose funding. It might also add more strain to a survivor's mental health issues â€” similar to what gaslighting could inflict on a person.
